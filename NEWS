What's New

  New and Updated Features

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.99.0:
     * Qt port:
          + You can now show and hide toolbars and major widgets using the
            View menu.
          + You can now set the time display format and precision.
          + The byte view widget is much faster, particularly when
            selecting large reassembled packets.
          + Hovering over a byte-view field causes the field to be
            highlighted and a description to be shown in the status bar.
          + An Italian translation has been added.

   The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
   since version 1.12.0:
     * The I/O Graph in the Gtk+ UI now supports an unlimited number of
       data points (up from 100k).
     * TShark now resets its state when changing files in ring-buffer
       mode.
     * Expert Info severities can now be configured.
     * Wireshark now supports external capture interfaces. External
       capture interfaces can be anything from a tcpdump-over-ssh pipe to
       a program that captures from proprietary or non-standard hardware.
       This functionality is not available in the Qt UI yet.
     * Qt port:
          + The Qt UI is now the default (program name is wireshark).
          + A Polish translation has been added.
          + The Interfaces dialog has been added.
          + The interface list is now updated when interfaces appear or
            disappear.
          + The Conversations and Endpoints dialogs have been added.
          + A Japanese translation has been added.
          + It is now possible to manage remote capture interfaces.
          + Windows: taskbar progress support has been added.
          + Most toolbar actions are in place and work.
          + More command line options are now supported

  Vendor-supplied Packages

   Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You
   can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
   system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be

     __________________________________________________________________

File Locations

   Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
   files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations
   vary from platform to platform. You can use About->Folders to find the
   default locations on your system.
