=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.99.0:

* Qt port:

** You can now show and hide toolbars and major widgets using the View menu.
** You can now set the time display format and precision.
** The byte view widget is much faster, particularly when selecting large
reassembled packets.
** Hovering over a byte-view field causes the field to be highlighted and a
description to be shown in the status bar.
** An Italian translation has been added.

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 1.12.0:

* The I/O Graph in the Gtk+ UI now supports an unlimited number of data points
(up from 100k).
* TShark now resets its state when changing files in ring-buffer mode.
* Expert Info severities can now be configured.

== Getting Wireshark

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
https://www.wireshark.org/download.html.

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
